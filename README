Dependencies:
- nightly Rust (won't build on stable)
- rust-bindgen installed to $PATH: run 'cargo install bindgen' (and wait, and
  wait...)
    - clang and libclang (required by my script and bindgen, respectively)
- python2.7

To build yasce, install a nightly Rust, and run

    make -j8 outopt/yasce OPT=1

Or for a debug version:

    make -j8 out/yasce

You can also build out/exectool, which is in development.

The release version is statically linked, except for libc; the debug version is
dynamically linked against both dylibs corresponding to the crates and the
standard library.

I develop on OS X; build has been tested (on some point) on Debian.
